# Laser-cutter-engraver ⚙️

![3D model](img/overview.png)
This is a laser cutter project designed by myself. The idea came from the need of such tool and not wanting to spend a load of money on prebuilt ones. Besides, it has been a great learning opportunity for me as I've never made such thing before and this was my first encounter with CAD.
